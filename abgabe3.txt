Infoviz

UPDATE: we found a new correct geojson.

a) GitHub: https://github.com/ly000/ws1718-infovis.git
b) 
- Color on Hover Changes, Click, css
- Districts Clickable, but not correct ID is shown (but name)
- Some sliders and boxes, no effects yet
- Heatmap from Real Data already implemented, but not correctly, as
GEOJSON-Map is not correct (the one which can be downloaded from the tutorial)


Horizontal Prototype:
So the basic visualization is standing, however, the faulty geojson contains 28
districts and in reality there are only 25. -> 3 are empty in our current layout. Base Map
shows the distribution of foreign people. 

c)
1. Heatmaps for other Data combine it with Buttons/sliders
2. Sidebox view: For comparison
3. Adjust colors
